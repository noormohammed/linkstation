This project serves the backend for the Link Station Frontend App which finds the most suitable (with most power) link station for a given device. Currently it has only one api end point /findLinkStationForDevice which finds the link station and is capable of handling errors as well.

## Usage

For example:
```
const request = {
  devicePoint: {
    x: 15,
    y: 10
  },
  linkStationPoints: [
    {
      x: 0,
      y: 0,
      z: 10
    },
    {
      x: 20,
      y: 20,
      z: 5
    },
    {
      x: 10,
      y: 0,
      z: 12
    }
  ]
